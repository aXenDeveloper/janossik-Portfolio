# This repository is responsible for the portfolio page of Marcin Czaniecki

I did this to show you my front end developer skills and tech stack.
I made this page.

I created this page with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the technologies listed below:

- typeScript
- styled-components
- react-router-dom

## Testing Application

For testing, I used the Jest and React Testing Library, which were already included in the Create React App

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can find all the rest of the information you need [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
